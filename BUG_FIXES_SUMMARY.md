# üêõ Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Cannot Add Story

**Problem**: Users were unable to add stories through the add story form.

**Root Cause**: Missing authentication check in the add story route.

**Solution**:

- Added authentication verification in `src/scripts/app.js` for the `#/add` route
- Users are now redirected to login if not authenticated when trying to access add story page

**Files Modified**:

- `src/scripts/app.js` - Added authentication check for add story route

### 2. üîî Push Notifications Not Showing

**Problem**: Push notifications were not appearing after story creation.

**Root Causes**:

- Notification helper not being properly initialized in add story presenter
- Missing proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Notification permissions not being requested at the right time

**Solutions**:

- Enhanced notification initialization in `AddStoryPresenter.init()`
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging notification issues
- Implemented fallback to simple browser notifications if service worker notifications fail
- Added notification permission request after user login
- Enhanced story notification handling with proper error catching

**Files Modified**:

- `src/presenters/add-story-presenter.js` - Enhanced notification initialization and handling
- `src/scripts/notification-helper-new.js` - Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms
- `src/views/auth-view.js` - Added login event for notification initialization
- `src/scripts/app.js` - Added event listener for post-login notification setup

### 3. üîó Not Found Page Navigation

**Problem**: "Share your story" link in 404 page was using incorrect hash format.

**Root Cause**: The link used `#add` instead of the correct `#/add` format expected by the router.

**Solution**:

- Updated all navigation links in not found view to use correct hash format
- Changed `#add` ‚Üí `#/add`, `#home` ‚Üí `#/`, `#map` ‚Üí `#/map`

**Files Modified**:

- `src/views/not-found-view.js` - Fixed navigation links to use correct hash format
